# Breakdown

This breakdown folder contains Jupyter Notebook that explains in detail how each and every part of the network is being implemented.
The details will be based on the original paper, [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), which in turn means that all examples will be an NLP task.
Additionally, [Transformer Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transformer_tutorial.html) from official PyTorch website and [Frank Odom's Medium Blog](https://medium.com/the-dl/transformers-from-scratch-in-pytorch-8777e346ca51), and [Jay Alammar's blog on Transformer Visualization](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) was used as my primary sources of reference. If the authors are reading this, thank you so much. 

Breakdown has 4 main sections:
1. InputEmbedding - Details how the input data gets encoded using the method described from the paper.
